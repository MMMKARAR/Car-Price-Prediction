# Car-Price-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting car prices for a Chinese automobile company planning to enter the U.S. market. The company aims to determine key factors affecting car prices and develop a predictive model to optimize pricing strategies.
# 🚀 Business Objectives
Identify significant variables influencing car prices.
Analyze pricing dynamics in the U.S. market.
Provide data-driven insights for car design and business strategies.
Develop and evaluate five different regression models for price prediction.
# 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes details on various cars in the U.S. market, such as make, model, engine type, and price. (Dataset link provided in the notebook.)

# 🔍 Key Tasks Completed

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Loaded and inspected the dataset.
Handled missing values and duplicates.
Performed feature engineering and standardized column names.

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Analysis: Examined variable distributions and outliers.
Bivariate Analysis: Explored relationships between price and key features.
Multivariate Analysis: Identified complex interactions among variables.

3️⃣ Feature Engineering
Encoded categorical variables using one-hot and label encoding.
Scaled numerical variables using StandardScaler.

4️⃣ Model Implementation
Developed and evaluated five regression models:

✅ Linear Regression

✅ Decision Tree Regressor

✅ Gradient Boosting Regressor

✅ Random Forest Regressor

✅ Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

5️⃣ Model Evaluation
Split the dataset (80% training, 20% testing).
Assessed models using R², Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

# 🔑 Findings and Insights

✔ Significant Factors: Engine size, horsepower, and brand reputation strongly influence car prices.

✔ Best Model: Gradient Boosting performed the best across all metrics.

✔ Regularization Benefits: Hyperparameter tuning significantly improved SVR performance, but Gradient Boosting and Random Forest remained superior.

✔ Market Trends: Luxury brands and advanced engine specifications drive higher prices, while fuel efficiency is valued in mid-range vehicles.

 📌 The insights gained from this project provide actionable strategies for the company to optimize pricing and enhance market competitiveness.
